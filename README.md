This is the code repository for [Mastering High Performance with Kotlin](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-high-performance-kotlin?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788996648), published by Packt.

**Find out how to write Kotlin code without overhead and how to use different profiling tools and bytecode viewer to inspect expressions of Kotlin language.**

## What is this book about?
The ease with which we write applications has been increasing, but with it comes the need to address their performance. A balancing act between easily implementing complex applications and keeping their performance optimal is a present-day requirement In this book, we explore how to achieve this crucial balance, while developing and deploying applications with Kotlin.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the importance of high performance 
* Learn performance metrics 
* Learn popular design patterns currently being used in Kotlin 
* Understand how to apply modern Kotlin features to data processing 
* Learn how to use profling tools

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.
To run examples from this book, you will need a computer running Windows, Linux, or Mac OS. You also need IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate edition version is preferable) and Android Studio. You need basic knowledge of GitHub and Git to clone a project with examples. Since Kotlin is an official language for Android development, Android Studio supports this language out of the box.

To build the project [import it as Maven project in Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/maven-support.html).

Project contains packages for each chapter that is splitted by sections:

Most of the examples contain a ```main``` function that can run by clicking the ![](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/img/idea/2018.1/run.png) icon in the left gutter and choose the Run or Debug command.

Project also contains benchmarks that can be run using the following commands:
1) Build a ```.jar``` file using this command at the root of the repository: ```mvn clean install```
2) To run the ```.jar``` with fast benchmarking: ```java -jar target/benchmarks.jar -wi 0 -i 1 -f 1 -tu ns -bm avgt```
   To run the ```.jar``` with default benchmarking: ```java -jar target/benchmarks.jar```


The code will look like the following:
```
public inline fun measureTimeMillis(block: () -> Unit) : Long {
    val start = System.currentTimeMillis()
    block()
    return System.currentTimeMillis() - start
}
```
